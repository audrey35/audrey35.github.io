        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>My name is Audrey Jo and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Computer Science
          at Northeastern University. Previously, I worked as a Geographic Information Systems
          (GIS) analyst, analyzing satellite imagery to identify patterns of wildfires and
          measuring evaporation. As a GIS analyst, I began to realize that my passion for
          programming, rather than GIS, had the power to change the company’s expectations of a
          GIS analyst and the ability to change the company culture to encourage collaboration.
          I wanted to become a developer and create a team of experts from different backgrounds,
          but a common desire to solve a challenging, multi-disciplinary problem.
          As a GIS analyst, I developed a variety of skills necessary for success in
          Computer Science including leadership and solving difficult problems as a team,
          in a timely manner. In my MSCS program, I have programmed in Java and used
          Spring Boot and Flask to build REST APIs for data stored in MongoDB and SQL databases.
          I love to learn and gather new information at a measured pace and give myself time
          and space to ponder and process the information. I believe that my experience as a
          GIS analyst, in conjunction with the skills I am developing in my MSCS program,
          will make me a fit for back-end developer position. My current goal is to find a co-op
          or internship position that will help me gain experience and an understanding of what
          it is really like to work as a developer.
